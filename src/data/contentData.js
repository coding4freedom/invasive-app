        introPara: "The non-native Burmese python has become a very devastating snake for the Florida Everglades ecosystem. Due to the Burmese python not having natural predators, they become very large by consuming nearly all the native creatures. Some of these animals are mainly mammals, birds, reptiles of varies sizes. The average size of Burmese python are from 8 to 10 feet, but can get up to 26 feet and weights of more than 200 pounds.",

        diet: "Since Burmese python are not picky eaters there diet ranges basically to what every can fit in their mouth. Being able to swin the Burmese python eat any fish it can caught. In the category of mammals they eat rats, mice, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, rabbites, bobcats and white-tailed deer. When it comes to birds Burmese python eat wading birds, waterfowl, herons egrets, and songbirds. In the reptiles they eat turtles, native snakes, varies lizards and alligators.",
        history: "Officals and local authorities believe that in August of 1992 Hurricane Andrew which was labeled as a category 5 storm disperse many exotic snakes. Just before the storm hit a exotic pets trade event was going on in Florida. The Hurricane was said to free some Burmese pythons during this event. The surrounding swamp ecosystem provided perfect condition to mimic their native environment. Female Burmese python can have anywhere from 12 to 100 eggs per year. Brand new burmese python hatchlings in around 60 days fromn egg being dropped.",
        control: "Florida has various methods to curve the ecological impact of the Burmese python. The brief overview of how Florida deals the python problem programs to eliminate the python numbers, public awareness efforts, monitoring systems and legal measures. Legally Burmese pythons are ban from release and listed as prohibited species in Florida. Some pythons are captured and microchipped to track there movements and travel patterns. Florida has an python elimination program cash reward based on size of snakes and how many are removed."

Wild hogs causing most damage to Texas, Florida and most southeastern states. Since the wild hog has no natural pedators there population grow exponentially. Sows (female hog) reach adulthood as early as 6 months, with the ability to breed several times a year. Litter size ranging from 4 to 12 piglets.",

        history: "Seeing as wild hogs have a long history in the US dating back to 1500's during the Spanish explorers. Also the rise of sport hunting throughout the 20th century its hard to point to one single event. Domesticated pigs escapted and interbred with wild ones creating the population we have today. ",
        control: "Since wild hogs are spread across many states, there are some factors that make it hard to deal with wild hog population. Rapid reproduction and highly adaptable proves to be a very challenge situation to overcome. Government agencies and farmers employ various method to deal with wild hog. Some of these techniques include trapping, hunting, fencing and gene targeting research. Many states allow hunting of wild hogs all year round. Currently research is underway to develop toxins that only target wild hogs.",

These fish include bighead, silver, grass, and black carp. Originally brought to the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s for aquaculture and pest control, they escaped into the wild and have since spread rapidly. With no natural predators and high reproductive rates, they threaten native fish populations and ecosystems.",

        diet: "Asian carp have different diets depending on the species. Bighead and silver carp filter-feed on plankton, which disrupts food chains for native fish. Grass carp primarily eat aquatic vegetation, leading to habitat destruction. Black carp feed on mollusks, endangering native mussel populations.",
        history: "Asian carp were introduced to the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s to help control algae and aquatic weeds in fish farms and wastewater treatment facilities. Flooding events allowed them to escape into the Mississippi River, where they spread uncontrollably. Their rapid reproduction and lack of predators have made them one of the most problematic invasive fish species in the U.S.",
        control: "Controlling Asian carp is difficult due to their high reproduction rates and ability to outcompete native fish. Federal and state agencies use electric barriers, commercial fishing, and netting to reduce populations. Efforts are also underway to prevent their spread into the Great Lakes, where they could devastate native fisheries. Research is being conducted on targeted poisons and genetic control methods to limit their numbers.",
